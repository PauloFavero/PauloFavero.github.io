    "bio":"I spent two years in exchange in Brest-France ❤️ studying engineering and computer science with a scholarship. In order to get practical experience, I did an internship as a software engineer at Siemens Corporate Technology developing software for autonomous robots. At this point, I discovered my passion for robots and computer vision. I really love to spend my free time cooking nice dishes and flying my FPV drone. I think that I have an uncommon set of sports which I like to practice. I practice archery and BMX Flatland. ",

I worked on the mechanical and electronic of the project. In relation to the mechanical domain, I was responsible for the confection of 3D printer parts with CAD software (PTC CREO PARAMETRIC) and the production of the boat sails. In electronics, I realized the motherboard of the boat, with the help of the software Proteus we made the electronic circuit and the assembly of the network of sensors and the actuators in that board."
