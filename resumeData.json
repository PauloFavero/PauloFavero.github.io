I worked on the mechanical and electronic of the project. In relation to the mechanical domain, I was responsible for the confection of 3D printer parts with CAD software (PTC CREO PARAMETRIC) and the production of the boat sails. In electronics, I realized the motherboard of the boat, with the help of the software Proteus we made the electronic circuit and the assembly of the network of sensors and the actuators in that board."
